# 🖼️ Image Classification Using ANN

This project demonstrates image classification using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with TensorFlow and Keras, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

✅ Load and preprocess image data  
✅ Build a simple feedforward ANN  
✅ Train with training & validation sets  
✅ Evaluate model performance  
✅ Save trained model (`.h5` format)

---

## 📚 Files

- `IMAGE Classification Using ANN.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook with the complete workflow
- `ANN_MODEL_{EPOCHS}.h5` : Saved trained model (after training)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- OpenCV / PIL (for image processing)

---

## 💻 How to Run

1. Install required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python
    ```

2. Open the notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "IMAGE Classification Using ANN.ipynb"
    ```

3. Run all cells to train the model.

## 📈 Example Outputs

- Accuracy & loss plots after training
- Saved ANN model file for reuse

---

## 🔥 Future Improvements

- Try CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for better image performance  
- Add data augmentation  
- Use callbacks for early stopping & best model saving
